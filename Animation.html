        Here’s my video, which i created via the use of vector graphic based art work which I created within the Adobe Illustrator application, for its later exportation into the Adobe After Effects Application.
        <br>These vector graphic based assets were then animated, further lighting, motion and blur created solely within Adobe After Effects, with music synthinised within a DAW (Digital Audio Workspace).
        <br><br>
        <strong>Creating:</strong><br><br>
        During the Production stage of creating this video, the Adobe Illustrotor app was used, vector graphic assets created. Here they were designed, coloured, shaded and grouped for later animation processes. After which, a atmospheric soundtrack was created with a synthiser within the Reaper app.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Editing:</strong><br><br>
        Throughout the Editing portion of this Animated video, the Adobe After Effects application was used.Here, the Illustrator (”.ai”) files created prior were imported, along with an export of the music, lighting and animation, the lighting created with a combination of 3D effects and the animation created with a series of keyframed and parented compositions.
